\section{Environment}
\subsection{Hardware environment}
As it is a parallel computing program. The environment must enable the team to test on single and on multiple entity the code produced. In order to do so the code will be tested on lab machines, which are the most likely to represent the IRIT environment. 
\subsection{Software environment}
This project implies the use of multiple technologies: Matlab, Fortran, MPI, ssh, Doxygen. The test must run on the client machine configuration.

\section{Test definition}
The following test must show the client that the code fit the specifications. It include non-regression test : the original code will be tested on the team configuration as a performance reference and will be compared to the new implemented algorithm result in term of efficiency and quality.

\textbf{Id}: T008
\textbf{Description}: We must show that the code refactoring has been successful \\
The code will be statically analyzed to show the improvement 

\textbf{Result}: The code readability, syntax must have been improved and standards must have applied : one language, one naming standard etc\\
